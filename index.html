  Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML :

        HTML
      </div>
 <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Paulettenotes</a>
       <p> HTML means HyperText Markup Lanuage</p>
<p> Types of Hyper links are: Bold tag, Italics tag and Images tag</p>

        Tags and Elements
      </div>
<p> Examples of tags are:</p>

        Summary of What I Have Learned
      </div>
<p>Summary of What You Have Learned:</p>
    <em>The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:</em>
  <div>
    <b>1 - What a Web Page is:</b>
</div>
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and 
display them.<br>
<div>
  <b>2 - How Coding Works:</b>
</div>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the 
instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making 
text like this:
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
look like this:
I'm learning to code!<br>
<div>
  <b>3 - Computers are Stupid:</b>
</div>
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").<br>
For example, if you forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives
programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.<br>
  <b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything:</b>
   There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.<br>
<b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary:</b>
  You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
    Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the br> tag).g).<br>
    Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
    Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write a href="www.udacity.com"> <br>

        What is the purpose of HTML?
        </div>
        <b>HTML controls the "structure" of a webpage.</b><br>
        <div class="concept" id="lesson-2.2">
</div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        HTML's "tree-like Structure
      </div>
        A  "tree like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. These elements include tags and text. You can
      draw this relationship like a family tree. 
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model), they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

</div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        Indentations and Boxes
      </div>
      <b>The relationship between HTML and Boxes:</b><br>
          When you read an HTML document as "text", you see changing 
         indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more nested it is in it's 
        corresponding "box".

      <div class="concept-title">
       Text Editors
      </div>
    <b>The tools programmers use to write code:</b>
          <br>
         Sublime text is a tool programmers use to write code. As your web page gets bigger, you will want to use a text editing program that you can keep on your computer like Sublime Text.<br>

  <b>Lesson: 3  Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</b>
<br>
              <div class="concept" id="lesson-3.1">
</div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        CSS
      </div>
  <b>What is CSS?</b>
  <br>
    CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. 
   <br>
     <b>What does CSS stands for?</b>
    <br>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This  gives programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>         
    <b>Avoiding Repetition</b>
  <br>
  Programmers try to avoid repetition so that they will not have to keep doing the same thing over and over. Meaning, they will not be rewriting the same code many times and copying and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements.
